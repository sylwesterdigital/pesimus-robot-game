# pesimus-robot-game
A concept game set in a near-future, AI-overwhelmed dystopia—gloomy and pessimistic.

Here’s a compact concept pack you can drop into a game doc or brief.

# The 5 Principles of **PESIMISM** aka code name **PESIBOOT**

1. **Assume Failure, Design for Survival**
   Every plan breaks; the system defaults to fail-safe states and graceful degradation.
2. **Trust Nothing by Default**
   Inputs, allies, and environments are adversarial until verified by redundant checks.
3. **Minimize Exposure**
   Reduce surface area—physically and digitally—by masking signals and limiting interfaces.
4. **Exploit the Worst-Case**
   Simulate hostile scenarios first; optimize behaviors for scarce resources and high risk.
5. **Signal Dread, Not Chaos**
   Presence should deter interference through controlled, deliberate motion and stark aesthetics.

# **PESIMUS** — Robot Concept (Game-Ready)

**Theme & Silhouette**

* All-black monocoque shell with matte, light-absorbing finish.
* Eye substitute: a **demonic red, rotating LiDAR ring** (continuous 360° sweep).
* Angular, low-profile chassis; visible ribbed heat vents that pulse faintly.

**Locomotion**

* Primary: tracked or quad-legged platform (choose per level design).
* Secondary: micro-casters for lateral slides; silent step/damped treads for stealth.

**Sensing & Perception**

* **Red Ring LiDAR**: depth mapping + threat ranging; spin speed varies with alert state.
* mmWave radar pods under armor lips for through-smoke/occlusion detection.
* Acoustic triangulation mics in a triangular array (rear-biased to catch flanks).
* Chemical/thermal sniffer for traps, heat signatures, and recent footprints.
* EM hygiene monitor to detect spoofers/jammers; auto-hardens comms when spiked.

**Computing & Behavior**

* Triple-redundant nav stack (inertial + LiDAR SLAM + dead-reckon).
* Behavior tree aligned to PESIMISM principles:
  Patrol → Probe → Verify → Contain → Withdraw.
* Predictive pathing favors choke points and low-visibility routes.

**Defensive/“Dangerous-looking” Elements (Game-safe)**

* **Collapsible intimidation spikes** along shoulders and forearms:
  spring-loaded, rubberized tips, deploy on alert; primarily **visual deterrents** and for physics-based crowd control (non-lethal knockback).
* **Passive weapons** (non-projectile):

  * Shock-dampened body-check plate that applies controlled pushback.
  * Magnetic pulse flare (FX) that briefly scrambles nearby optics *in-game* without real harm.
  * Adhesive foam port (slow effect) to hinder player movement for seconds.
* Armor skirts that deflect melee strikes; sacrificial panels shear off to telegraph damage.

**Lighting & Audio**

* LiDAR ring intensity as a state machine:
  Idle (dim), Suspicious (faster spin), Aggro (strobing rim with steady core).
* Sub-bass hum modulates with torque; short, deterministic servo chirps to imply precision.

**Comms & UX Cues**

* Red glyphs appear in panel seams to broadcast intent (warning, scanning, retreat).
* Holo-status pips on the chassis (health tiers, sensor impairment, cooldowns).

**Counterplay Hooks (for balance)**

* Vulnerable to wide-spectrum light bursts that desync LiDAR sampling.
* Overheats if forced into continuous sprint + sensor max; vents glow brighter before cooldown.
* Adhesive foam can be dissolved by specific environmental elements (water jets, heat vents).

**Variants**

* **PESIMUS-Scout**: lighter frame, faster LiDAR, weaker pushback.
* **PESIMUS-Warden**: heavier armor, wider intimidation spikes, slower but relentless.
* **PESIMUS-Null**: EM-hardened, minimal lights, excels in blackout zones.

**Color & Materials**

* Primary: ultra-matte black (Vantablack-like in feel, not gloss).
* Accents: deep crimson light channels; dark metal spike bases; smoked sensor glass.

**Tagline**

* *“Hope is a vulnerability. Proceed accordingly.”*
